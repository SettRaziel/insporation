# insporation\*

A native [diaspora\*](https://diasporafoundation.org) client powered by Flutter.

> This is still in early development. You will need a pod on the latest develop branch. Contributions are welcome, please open an issue if you work on something bigger to avoid duplicated effort :)

## Installation

If you don't know how to build an Android or Flutter app, this is probably not yet for you! As soon as this is polished enough, it will appear in the ususal stores.

In case you want to dare anyways:

1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
2. Install Android SDK
3. Clone this repo
4. Connect your ADB debugging enabled device and `flutter run` :)
