# insporation\*

A native [diaspora\*](https://diasporafoundation.org) client powered by Flutter.

> This is still in preview. You will need a pod on the latest develop branch. Contributions are welcome, please open an issue if you work on something bigger to avoid duplicated effort :)

## Installation

As soon as this is out of preview it will appear in the usual stores. Until then you have the following options:

### Download latest nightly build

You can go to the [releases page](https://github.com/jhass/insporation/releases) to download and install the latest build manually.

### F-Droid repository

The nightlies are also published to a F-Droid repository which you can add by scanning the following QR code:

or clicking [this link](https://jhass.github.io/insporation/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=EC792A58B39DF9FBB466FB100E30E3842F229FDBC6E28D32C417F6A5B30ECCAE) on your device that has F-Droid installed.

### Build it yourself

If you don't know how to build an Android or Flutter app, this is probably not for you!
In case you want to dare anyways:

1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
2. Install Android SDK
3. Clone this repo
4. Connect your ADB debugging enabled device and `flutter run` :)
